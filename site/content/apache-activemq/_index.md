##### ApacheActiveMQHighTopicMemoryUsage

{{< code lang="yaml" >}}
alert: ApacheActiveMQHighTopicMemoryUsage
annotations:
  description: '{{ printf "%.0f" $value }} percent of memory used by topics on {{$labels.instance}}
    in cluster {{$labels.activemq_cluster}}, which is above the threshold of 70 percent.'
  summary: Topic destination memory usage is high, which may result in a reduction
    of the rate at which producers send messages.
expr: |
  sum without (destination) (activemq_topic_memory_percent_usage{destination!~"ActiveMQ.Advisory.*"}) > 70
for: 5m

    in cluster {{$labels.activemq_cluster}}, which is above the threshold of 70 percent.'
  summary: Temporary memory usage is high, which may result in saturation of messaging
    throughput.
